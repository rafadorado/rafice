<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2"> Where is the wedding taking place?</h2> 
<p> Both the wedding ceremony and the celebrations will take place the same location in <a class="link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/gCK5VwoqJWJPg2rb9" target="_blank">Can Palleta</a>, S'horta, Felanitx, Mallorca. Can Palleta is a villa with a garden and pool, everything will take place outdoors. </p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4"> What will the weather be like?</h2> 
<p>The weather is usually quite warm in early June in with temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees celcius. The wedding starts later in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day. Don't forget to bring suncream, hats and sunglasses. </p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4"> What is the dress code?</h2> 
<p>You can wear whatever you feel comfortable in to our wedding, there is no dress code! As the weather will be warm, you should wear summer clothes and you may need a light jacket for the evening.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4"> Can I bring a plus 1?</h2> 
<p>We are looking forward to sharing this special day with the people we care about. Unfortunately we are limited by space and cost and cannot offer all our guests a plus 1. Please do not bring a plus 1 to our wedding if we have not invited them ourselves. </p>
<p>This is an adults wedding. For those travelling from outside of Mallorca, of course the little ones are invited. Please let us know if you will be bringing any children in the RSVP form.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4"> What food and drink will be at the wedding?</h2> 
<p>We will have plenty of food and drinks throughout the event, see the full schedule <a class="link" href="{base}/schedule" target="_blank">here</a>. We will have a mixture of vegan, vegetarian and meat options. If you have any dietry requirements or allergies you can let us know in the RSVP form.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4">Is there a gifts registry?</h2> 
<p>As cheesy as it sounds, your presence at our wedding is a present in itself, we don't expect any gifts. However, we will have a letterbox for wedding cards at the ceremony. If you want to give us a little something for our honeymoon, we will be adding a link to this webpage later on for you to contribute online.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mb-2 mt-4">Can we park at the wedding venue?</h2> 
<p>There will be parking spaces at the wedding venue. We will be putting up signs near the entrance to the venue to direct you. If you plan to park at the venue, please let us know in the RSVP form.</p>
